This is a full-stack CRM Lead Management System built with React, Node.js, and Express. The application features a sleek dark navy dashboard with real-time KPIs, interactive charts, and a complete sales pipeline management system. Users can manage leads through a traditional table view or a Kanban-style board, track activities and communications, assign tasks with due dates, and visualize schedules on a calendar. The system includes role-based authentication with three access levels — Admin, Manager, and Agent — each with different permissions. Additional features include customer account management seeded with 85+ real company records, email template creation, automation triggers, lead source tracking, and a sales forecast module. The backend uses a custom built pure JavaScript JSON database engine with no native dependencies, making it easy to set up on any machine without requiring additional build tools. The entire application was designed and built from scratch with a professional UI matching real-world CRM systems.
